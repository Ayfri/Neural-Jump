## Introduction

SuperMarioAI is a platformer game inspired by the classic Mario games. The project aims to implement AI agents that learn to play the game
using deep reinforcement learning techniques. The AI agents navigate through levels, avoiding obstacles, collecting rewards, and improving
their performance over time.

## Features

- Mario-like platformer gameplay
- AI agents with neural networks
- Dynamic learning and adaptation
- Visual representation of AI decision-making
- Level design using text files

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayfri/Neural-Jump.git
    ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python run-ai.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the game by running the `run-ai.py` script.
2. Watch the AI agents learn to play the game.
3. Observe the agents' performance and decision-making process.
4. Modify the game settings and level design to experiment with different scenarios.

You can also run `run-game.py` to play the game manually.
